# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This repository consists of a Machine Learning model to predict heart disease and the corresponding files for deployment.

## Problem Definition:
Given the medical parameters and details about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## Data Analysis

The data was initially checked for missing values and central tendency values were derived from the data. 
The data was also checked whether it is an imbalanced dataset or not.
The features where then categorised as continuous and categorical values.
Plotting was done on basis of the result and different categories.
Plotting was also done based on the correlation of features.

## Data Preprocessing

The categorical features were converted into dummy variables and the numerical features were scaled.
The data was divided into train and test data.

## Machine Learning Model

Machine Learning models were created using Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier

Further predictions were also done and the model was evaluated using metrics.

## Deployment

The model of choice was then converted to a pickle file or further deployment.
